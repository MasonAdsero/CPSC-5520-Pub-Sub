## CPSC 5520 Pub/Sub Lab

# Description
In this lab I made a program that implemented the publisher and subscriber model. In this specific instance the we want to detect arbitrage. The subscriber subscribes to the forex price provider who is the publisher in this example. Another part of this project was coding the Bellman Ford algorithm to actually detect arbitrage oppurtunities.
